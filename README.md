# Quality control for MinION sequencing data

## What?

An R script for quality control of data from Oxford Nanopore's MinION sequencer, using the `sequencing_summary.txt` file from Albacore as input.

## Why?

Other tools focus on getting data out of the fastq or fast5 files, which is slow and computationally intensive. The benefit of this approach is that it works on a single, small, .txt summary file. So it's a lot quicker than most other things out there: it takes about a minute to analyse a 4GB flowcell on my laptop. 

## Quick start

To run it on one `sequencing_summary.txt` file:

```
Rscript MinionQC.R -i sequencing_summary.txt -o output_directory
```

To run it on a directory with multiple `sequencing_summary.txt` files:

```
Rscript MinionQC.R -i parent_directory -o output_directory
```


* **MinionQC.R**: path to this script
* **sequencing_summary.txt**: path to a `sequencing_summary.txt` file from Albacore
* **output_directory**: path to an output directory. Files will be overwritten.
* **parent_directory**: path to an input directory that contains one or more `sequencing_summary.txt` files in subfolders


## Options

Can be viewed by typing `Rscript MinionQC.R -h` at the commandline.

```
Options:
  -h, --help
    Show this help message and exit

  -i INPUT, --input=INPUT
    Input file or directory (required). Either a full path to a sequence_summary.txt file, or a full path to a directory containing one or more such files. In the latter case the directory is searched recursively.

  -o OUTPUTDIRECTORY, --outputdirectory=OUTPUTDIRECTORY
    Output directory (required). If a single sequencing_summary.txt file is passed as input, then the output directory will contain just the plots associated with that file. If a directory containing more than one sequencing_summary.txt files is passed as input, then the plots will be put into sub-directories that have the same names as the parent directories of each sequencing_summary.txt file

  -q QSCORE_CUTOFF, --qscore_cutoff=QSCORE_CUTOFF
    The cutoff value for the mean Q score of a read (default 7). Used to create separate plots for reads above and below this threshold

  -p PROCESSORS, --processors=PROCESSORS
    Number of processors to use for the anlaysis (default 1). Only helps when you are analysing more than one sequencing_summary.txt file at a time
```

## Installation

The point of this script is that it requires no interaction and no installation of any meaningful kind. 

#### I just want the script

Use `curl` or `wget` to get just the script (which is all you need)

```
# this
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/roblanf/minion_qc/master/MinionQC.R > MinionQC.R

# or this
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/roblanf/minion_qc/master/MinionQC.R > MinionQC.R
```

#### I want the example input and output too

This comes as a file that is ~100MB. Download the `.zip` or `.tar.gz` file from here: https://github.com/roblanf/minion_qc/releases/latest/

If you want to run the example input, one option is to change directories to the file containing the `MinonQC.R` script and type:

```
Rscript MinionQC.R -i example_input -o my_example_output -p 2
```

## Dependencies
A recent version of R, and install the following:

```
install.packages("data.table")
install.packages("futile.logger")
install.packages("ggplot2")
install.packages("optparse")
install.packages("plyr")
install.packages("reshape2")
install.packages("scales")
install.packages("scales")
install.packages("viridis")
install.packages("yaml")
```

## Output details
The following output was created by running the script on the example input files, which contains data from two flowcells from our lab.

```
Rscript MinionQC.R -i example_input -o example_output/RB7_A2/minionQC
```

Two kinds of output are produced. Output for each flowcell, and then additional output for the combined flowcells to allow for comparison.

### Output for each flowcell

The script will produce 10 files for each flowcell. Here I explain each of these files, from the `example_output/RB7_A2/minionQC/` folder.

#### summary.yaml

A text summary of the data in yaml format (opens in any text editor, but can also be read by any coding language). One of these is produced for each flowcell, and one for the combined flowcells. The statstics are repeated for all of the data, and for the data above the Q threshold (which is 7 by default, but can be changed with `-q` at the commandline).

#### length_histogram.png
Read length on a log10 scale (x axis) vs counts (y axis).
![length_histogram](example_output/RB7_A2/minionQC/length_histogram.png)

#### q_histogram.png
Mean Q score for a read (x axis) vs counts (y axis). 
![q_histogram](example_output/RB7_A2/minionQC/q_histogram.png)

#### length_vs_q.png
Read length on a log10 scale (x axis) vs mean Q score (y axis). Points are coloured by the events per base. 'Good' reads are ~1.5 events per base, and 'bad' reads are >>1.5 events per base. We often see a group of very short 'bad' reads.
![length_vs_q](example_output/RB7_A2/minionQC/length_vs_q.png)

#### length_by_hour.png
The mean read length (y axis) over time (x axis).
![length_by_hour](example_output/RB7_A2/minionQC/length_by_hour.png)

#### q_by_hour.png
The mean Q score (y axis) over time (x axis).
![q_by_hour](example_output/RB7_A2/minionQC/q_by_hour.png)

#### reads_per_hour.png
The number of reads (y axis) obtained in each hour (x axis).
![q_by_hour](example_output/RB7_A2/minionQC/reads_per_hour.png)

#### yield_summary.png
The total yield (y axis) for any given minimum read length (x axis). This is just like the 'reads' table in the `summary.yaml` output, but done across all read lengths up to 100KB. I cut off at 100KB because you (probably) don't have most of your data at those lenghts. Good on you if you do though.
![yield_summary](example_output/RB7_A2/minionQC/yield_summary.png)

#### channel_summary.png
Histograms of total bases, total reads, mean read length, and median read length that show the variance across the 512 available channels. Repeated for all data and reads with Q>10.
![channel_summary](example_output/RB7_A2/minionQC/channel_summary.png)

#### flowcell_overview.png
The 512 channels are laid out as on the R9.5 flowcell. Each panel of the plot shows time on the x axis, and read length on the y axis. Points are coloured by the Q score. This gives a little insight into exactly what was going on in each of your channels over the course of the run. You'll notice that in the example output for `RB7_D3` (the second plot below) you can see clearly that there was a bubble on the right-hand-side of the flowcell.

### Output for the combined data

9 files are produced that summarise the combined data across all flowcells. Examples are in the `example_output/combinedQC/` folder. 

#### summary.yaml
As above, but for all data combined across flowcells. Useful for knowing where your project is up to so far.

#### combined_length_histogram.png
Read length, on a log10 scale, from the combined data on the X axis, and read counts on the Y axis.
![combined_length_histogram](example_output/combinedQC/combined_length_histogram.png)

#### combined_q_histogram.png
Mean Q score for a read on the X axis, and counts on the Y axis. From the combined data across all flowcells.
![combined_q_histogram](example_output/combinedQC/combined_q_histogram.png)

#### combined_yield_summary.png
The total yield (y axis) for any given minimum read length (x axis), from all data combined.
![combined_yield_summary](example_output/combinedQC/combined_yield_summary.png)

#### length_distributions.png
Read length on a log10 scale (x axis) vs density (y axis). One line per flowcell. This allows for comparison of read length distributions across flowcells, but it's hard to use these kinds of plots to compare yields. For that, use the `yield_summary.png` plot (see below).
![length_distributions](example_output/combinedQC/length_distributions.png)

#### q_distributions.png
Mean Q score of a read (x axis) vs density (y axis). One line per flowcell.

#### length_by_hour.png
The readlength (y axis) over time (x axis).

#### q_by_hour.png
The mean Q score accross reads (y axis) over time (x axis).
![q_by_hour](example_output/combinedQC/q_by_hour.png)

#### yield_summary.png
The total yield (y axis) for any given minimum read length (x axis). One line per flowcell.
