# Quality control for MinION sequencing data

## What?

We're just getting started with MinION data, so we thought we'd share our QC scripts

## Why? 

MinION data is great.

## Getting started

1. Install poretools: http://poretools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/content/installation.html

2. Set the input out and output directories you want at the top of the script

3. Run the script like this:

```
sh minion_qc.sh
```

The script will write a bunch of stuff to the output directory.
